# Overview


## Scoping detail

The audit will encompass the following files, each integral to the functioning of the protocol:

1. **Curves.sol**: This is the primary file of the Curves protocol. It contains the core logic and functions that define the overall behavior and rules of the system. This file started as a fork of friend.tech FriendtechSharesV1.sol

2. **CurvesERC20.sol**: This file defines the ERC20 token that will be created upon exporting a Curve token. It outlines the token's properties and behaviors consistent with the ERC20 standard.

3. **CurvesERC20Factory.sol**: Serving as an ERC20 factory, this file abstracts the logic for ERC20 token creation. Its primary purpose is to streamline the token creation process and reduce the overall footprint of the protocol, ensuring efficiency and scalability.

4. **FeeSplitter.sol**: This script manages the distribution of fees. It is responsible for the fair and accurate division of transaction fees amongst token holders, in line with the protocol's incentive structure.

5. **Security.sol**: This file standardizes the security criteria for the protocol. It includes protocols and measures designed to safeguard the system against vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with established security standards.

Each of these files plays a crucial role in the protocolâ€™s architecture and functionality. The audit will methodically evaluate them for security, efficiency, and adherence to best practices in smart contract development.

## Summary

The Curves protocol, an extension of friend.tech, introduces several innovative features. For context on friend.tech, consider this insightful article: [Friend Tech Smart Contract Breakdown](https://medium.com/valixconsulting/friend-tech-smart-contract-breakdown-c5588ae3a1cf). Key enhancements in the Curves protocol include:

1. Token Export to ERC20: This pivotal feature allows users to transfer their tokens from the Curves protocol to the ERC20 format. Such interoperability significantly expands usability across various platforms. Within Curves, tokens lack decimal places, but when converted to ERC20, they adopt a standard 18-decimal format. Importantly, users can seamlessly reintegrate their ERC20 tokens into the Curves ecosystem, albeit only as whole, integer units.

2. Referral Fee Implementation: Curves empowers protocols built upon its framework by enabling them to earn a percentage of all user transaction fees. This incentive mechanism benefits both the base protocol and its derivative platforms.

3. Presale Feature: Learning from the pitfalls of friend.tech, particularly issues with frontrunners during token launches, Curves incorporates a presale phase. This allows creators to manage and stabilize their tokens prior to public trading, ensuring a more controlled and equitable distribution.

4. Token Holder Fee: To encourage long-term holding over short-term trading, Curves introduces a fee distribution model that rewards token holders. This fee is proportionally divided among all token holders, incentivizing sustained investment in the ecosystem.

These additions by Curves not only enhance functionality but also foster a more robust and inclusive financial ecosystem.

Any file not listed in the scope above is out of scope.

# Additional Context

- [ ] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [ ] Please list specific ERC20 that your protocol is anticipated to interact with. Could be "any" (literally anything, fee on transfer tokens, ERC777 tokens and so forth) or a list of tokens you envision using on launch.
- [ ] Please list specific ERC721 that your protocol is anticipated to interact with.
- [ ] Which blockchains will this code be deployed to, and are considered in scope for this audit?
- [ ] Please list all trusted roles (e.g. operators, slashers, pausers, etc.), the privileges they hold, and any conditions under which privilege escalation is expected/allowable
- [ ] In the event of a DOS, could you outline a minimum duration after which you would consider a finding to be valid? This question is asked in the context of most systems' capacity to handle DoS attacks gracefully for a certain period.
- [ ] Is any part of your implementation intended to conform to any EIP's? If yes, please list the contracts in this format: 
  - `Contract1`: Should comply with `ERC/EIPX`
  - `Contract2`: Should comply with `ERC/EIPY`
